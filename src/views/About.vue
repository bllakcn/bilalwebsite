        Hi, I am Bilal. <br><br>
        Currently pursuing Architecture Bachelor's degree at Budapest University of Technology and Economics and practicing UI design and development skills in free times.<br><br>
        Addressing myself as a jack of all trades but, in the meantime, not neglecting the importance of excelling at the main profession. Eager to help others learn and thrive in anything I can get my hands on. This has always been one of my main sources of motivation to study more and, thus, help more.<br><br>
        Passionate and reading about design, technology and psychology with the ultimate goal of combining them in the future career.<br><br>
        Feel free to contact me.
